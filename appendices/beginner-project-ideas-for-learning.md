   * Extend: Add a feature that tells them how many days or months until their next birthday.
4. **Even or Odd**
   * Write a program that asks the user for a number and tells them whether it's even or odd.
   * Extend: Let the program analyze a list of numbers for even and odd results.
5. **Temperature Converter**
   * Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
   * Extend: Add conversions for Kelvin and let the user choose which conversion to perform.
6. **Simple Interest Calculator**
   * Ask the user for a principal amount, interest rate, and time period, then calculate simple interest.
   * Extend: Add the option to calculate compound interest.
7. **Number Guessing Game**
   * Generate a random number and ask the user to guess it, providing hints if their guess is too high or too low.
   * Extend: Track the number of attempts and give a score at the end.
8. **Basic Countdown Timer**
   * Write a countdown timer that starts from a user-specified number of seconds.
   * Extend: Add sound or text alerts when the timer finishes.
9. **Multiplication Table Generator**
   * Ask the user for a number and print its multiplication table up to 10.
   * Extend: Allow the user to specify the range for the table (e.g., up to 12 or 20).
10. **BMI Calculator**
    * Write a program that calculates the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight.
    * Extend: Suggest whether the user's BMI is in the normal range or not.

### Beginner Project Ideas (Level 2)

These projects are for learners who understand basic concepts and want to practice using loops, lists, and basic data structures.

1. **Rock, Paper, Scissors**
   * Write a program that lets the user play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer.
   * Extend: Add a score tracker that keeps track of wins, losses, and draws.
2. **Palindrome Checker**
   * Ask the user for a word and check if itâ€™s a palindrome (a word that reads the same backward as forward).
   * Extend: Allow the user to check sentences or phrases, ignoring spaces and punctuation.
3. **Simple To-Do List**
   * Create a simple to-do list where users can add tasks, view tasks, and remove tasks.
   * Extend: Allow the user to mark tasks as completed.
4. **Basic Quiz Game**
   * Write a quiz game that asks multiple-choice questions and gives the user a score at the end.
   * Extend: Allow the user to add their own questions and answers.
5. **Simple Password Generator**
   * Write a program that generates random passwords based on user-specified length.
   * Extend: Add options for including special characters, numbers, or uppercase letters.
6. **Simple Unit Converter**
   * Create a program that converts units like inches to centimeters, pounds to kilograms, etc.
   * Extend: Add more units and give the user a menu to select which conversion they want.
7. **Word Counter**
   * Write a program that counts the number of words in a sentence or paragraph provided by the user.
   * Extend: Count the number of characters, sentences, and unique words.
8. **Guess the Word Game**
   * Ask the user to guess a word, letter by letter (like Hangman).
   * Extend: Add a score based on how many attempts the user took.
9. **Random Name Picker**
   * Create a program that randomly selects a name from a list of names entered by the user.
   * Extend: Make the program keep track of how many times each name has been selected.
10. **Basic Contact Book**
    * Create a contact book where the user can add, view, and delete contact information.
    * Extend: Add a search feature that lets the user look up contacts by name.

### Beginner with Some Experience (Level 3)

These projects involve more advanced structures like dictionaries, file handling, and some basic algorithms.

1. **Simple File Reader/Writer**
   * Write a program that reads from and writes to a text file. Allow the user to enter text and save it to a file.
   * Extend: Add functionality to read and display the file contents.
2. **Prime Number Checker**
   * Write a program that checks if a number is prime.
   * Extend: Allow the program to list all prime numbers up to a given number.
3. **Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder**
   * Write a program that encodes and decodes messages using the Caesar cipher.
   * Extend: Add support for other types of simple ciphers.
4. **Basic Alarm Clock**
   * Create a basic alarm clock that alerts the user at a specified time.
   * Extend: Add the ability to set multiple alarms and give them labels.
5. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
   * Write a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played in the console.
   * Extend: Add a simple AI for the computer to play against the user.
6. **Hangman Game**
   * Write a program that simulates the game Hangman, where the user guesses letters to form a word.
   * Extend: Add a feature to load words from a file.
7. **Simple Budget Tracker**
   * Create a program that helps the user track their income and expenses.
   * Extend: Add categories for expenses and generate reports based on spending.
8. **Simple Encryption/Decryption**
   * Write a program that can encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple algorithm.
   * Extend: Implement more advanced encryption techniques, like substitution ciphers.
9. **Number Frequency Analyzer**
   * Ask the user for a list of numbers and display how many times each number appears in the list.
   * Extend: Sort the list and display the frequency in descending order.
10. **Basic Web Scraper**
    * Use a Python library like `BeautifulSoup` to scrape data from a website.
    * Extend: Extract specific data, such as headlines or product prices, and save them to a file.
