# Python Interpreter

### [www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)

This is the core Python interpreter and is required in order to run the programs you create.  It is a very simple install.  In Linux and MacOS, python is already installed.  You can install another instance if the version on your system is too old, etc. &#x20;

Python includes a few small programs:

* **Python** - The core interpreter
* **Pip** - A tool for adding modules that give you more features, when you need them.
* **PipEnv** - A tool to create different environments for the different programs you write.  This becomes more important later one when you write programs that need different modules than the other programs you have written.  Like a game versus a financial app.  This becomes useful as you become more advanced.
* **IDLE** - A built in script editor.  Most people never use this.
