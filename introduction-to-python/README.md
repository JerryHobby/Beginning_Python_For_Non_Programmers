# Introduction to Python

Python is a widely-used, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, with its first public release in 1991. Van Rossum’s vision for Python was to create a language that emphasized code readability and allowed programmers to express their ideas with fewer lines of code compared to other languages. This focus on simplicity and ease of use has made Python a favorite among beginners and professionals alike.

Python is often described as a "general-purpose" language, meaning it can be used for a wide variety of tasks—from web development and automation to data analysis and machine learning. One of Python’s biggest strengths is its vast ecosystem of libraries and tools that make it versatile and powerful. Despite its simplicity, Python is used by major tech companies like Google, Netflix, and Instagram to power some of their most important systems.

Because of its user-friendly design and widespread use, Python has become a popular language for teaching programming in schools and universities around the world. It’s an excellent choice for beginners because its syntax (the rules for writing code) is easy to understand, allowing new programmers to focus on learning programming concepts without getting overwhelmed by complex language details. Whether you’re building your first project or solving real-world problems, Python provides a strong foundation to grow your programming skills.
