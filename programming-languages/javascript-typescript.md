# JavaScript / TypeScript

TypeScript is just a variation of JavaScript.  Both are flexible utility languages and are very popular, especially for Web applications.  You can learn JavaScript on it's own, but most often it's a component in a web app, so you need to learn HTML/CSS before you dive into JavaScript.

The example below embeds JavaScript into an HTML page.

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>

</html>
```
