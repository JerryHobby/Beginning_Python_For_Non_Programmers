# HTML / CSS

These languages are used for Web Design.   Frequently these are bundled with other languages, like Python or JavaScript to create web pages that have a high amount of functionality.

HTML is not really a programming language.  There are not any functions or executable code.  It's what we call a MARK-UP language.  It basically is used to instruct the computer exactly how to display things on the screen. Positions, colors, sizes, etc.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
	<title>HTML and CSS "Hello World"</title>
	<style>
		body {
			background-color: #2D2D2D;
		}
		
		h1 {
			color: #C26356;
			font-size: 30px;
			font-family: Menlo, Monaco, fixed-width;
		}
		
		p {
			color: white;
			font-family: "Source Code Pro", Menlo, Monaco, fixed-width;
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Hello World Example</h1>
	<p>This is a very basic "Hello World" example made up in HTML and CSS. See if you can change the size of the header text above.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
