# Java

Java is popular for Android development as well as creating applications that run on Windows or Macs. It's claim to fame is that one set of code can run on multiple operating systems.  Java programmers have a love/hate relationship with this language.  It can get really complicated.  If you've ever played Minecraft, that was written in Java.

```
    class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
        }
    }
```
