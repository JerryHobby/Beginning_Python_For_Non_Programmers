# SQL - Standard Query Language

The SQL language is a special language designed 
specifically to fetch or update data in a database.
This gives you the ability to add larges amounts of data
and your program can access portions of that data as needed.

Every programming language has the ability to connect to a 
database.  Some programming languages provide their own way
to read and write that data.  Whether you do it that way or
whether you use the SQL language will be an option to consider 
when you write that code.

SQL language includes very basic commands such as:

SELECT

INSERT

UPDATE

DELETE

There are other commands used to create databases and tables
as well.  Most business applications will use a SQL type database
and that's where you will get the data that you need to read or 
update with your program.
