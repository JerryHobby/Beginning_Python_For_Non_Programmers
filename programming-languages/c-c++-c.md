# C, C++, C\#

### C&#x20;

The C programming language was designed to give programmers the ability to write code that's fast and portable.  Operating systems and device drivers are usually written in C.

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  printf("Hello world\n");
  return 0;
}
```

### C++

C++ was introduced to add object oriented capabilities to the C language.  Over the years, C++ has evolved quite a bit and does not look much like C anymore.  It is still considered to be a harder language than most.&#x20;

```
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

### C\#

C# started by trying to simplify C programming.  It's evolved enough that it's actually quite different than C or C++, even though the name is similar.  It gives you the ability to write advanced native applications for Windows or Macs without having to learn some of the harder aspects that you have to do manually in C or C++.  It's a great language.  After you've learned Python or JavaScript, it is a good second language.

```
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
     class Program
     {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
             Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
     }
}
```
