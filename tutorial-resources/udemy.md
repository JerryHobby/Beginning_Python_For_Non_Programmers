Typically sells courses for under $20 each.  Some are great, some are not.  Previews are available.  Make sure you review the course outline and play a sample video to see how it feels for you.  I have found some instructors are not worth watching.

Personally I purchased the all-access license on udemy.  This way I can take whatever course I want.  If you prefer to buy one course at a time, every course seems to always be on sale at all times.
