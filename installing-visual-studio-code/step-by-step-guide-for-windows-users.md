# Step-by-step guide for Windows Users

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful code editor that’s perfect for Python development. Follow these steps to install and set up VS Code on your Windows computer.

#### Step 1: Download Visual Studio Code

1. Open your web browser and go to the official VS Code website: [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).
2. On the homepage, click the **Download for Windows** button. This will download the VS Code installer for Windows.

#### Step 2: Run the Installer

1. Once the installer is downloaded, locate it in your **Downloads** folder and double-click the file to launch the setup wizard.
2. When the installation window opens, read and accept the **License Agreement**, then click **Next**.

#### Step 3: Select Installation Options

1. In the next window, you can choose the destination folder for the installation. You can keep the default location or choose a different one, then click **Next**.
2. You’ll now see several additional tasks you can select before installing:
   * **Add “Open with Code” to the Windows Explorer context menu**: Check this box. It allows you to open files or folders directly in VS Code from your file explorer.
   * **Add to PATH**: This option makes it easier to run VS Code from the command line. Make sure this box is checked.
3. Once you’ve selected the additional options, click **Next** and then **Install**.

#### Step 4: Complete the Installation

1. The installer will now copy the necessary files to your system. This might take a few minutes.
2. After the installation is complete, click the **Finish** button. Make sure the option **Launch Visual Studio Code** is checked to open VS Code immediately after installation.

#### Step 5: Install the Python Extension

1. Once VS Code opens, you’ll want to install the Python extension, which adds all the features you need for Python development.
2. On the left side of the window, click the **Extensions** icon (or press **Ctrl+Shift+X**).
3. In the search bar at the top of the Extensions panel, type **Python**.
4. Select the extension titled **Python** (by Microsoft) and click the **Install** button.
5. Once installed, this extension provides features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging for Python.

#### Step 6: Verify Python is Installed in VS Code

1. After installing the Python extension, VS Code will automatically detect the Python interpreter installed on your system.
2. To verify this, open the **Command Palette** by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+P**, then type `Python: Select Interpreter`.
3. You should see a list of Python versions available on your system. Select the appropriate version (usually the latest version).
