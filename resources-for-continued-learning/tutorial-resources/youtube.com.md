Completely random, but a lot of great content.  Many course creators will put shortened courses on Youtube in order to promote themselves.  I'm a big fan of several Youtube creators.  But again, you have to hunt around until you find a course that goes at your learning speed.

Youtube videos are better for situations where you want to learn a specific topic and not as good for full length training.
