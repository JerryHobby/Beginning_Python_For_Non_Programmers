GameDev.tv is not designed for absolute beginners.  It teaches game development.  Game developing is a special category of programming.  It uses different tools, in some cases specialized languages, and is not the best place to learn basic programming.

However, if you want to become a game developer, this is the best website I've found for that topic.  They teach Unreal, Unity, Godot, Blender, and more.   This is where I spend most of my time these days.
