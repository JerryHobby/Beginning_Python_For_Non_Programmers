# Tutorial Resources

If you search the web for programming courses, you will find thousands of courses that claim to be the best place to start.  It's too difficult to sort through them all.  What most people end up doing is just going to youtube and taking a few courses there.  But that's a challenge because you'll have different people teaching you different things in different ways.  It's not cohesive.

Some sites, such as www.udemy.com, allows anyone to put a course online.  The result is again hundreds of courses by different people, all with different teaching styles.   At least with udemy.com you will find complete courses instead of random videos as you would find on youtube.

Some of the best instructors also have their own sites where they also offer other courses.  This is nice because if you find an instructor that you like, you can continue your learning journey with them.

I've included a few links here to help you explore.  There are countless other talented instructors and sites out there. I just want to give a shout-out to some of my favorites.

### Certifications

Most of these sites offer some type of certificate when you complete the course.  You can save these and build up your stack of certificates.  Just keep in mind that to hiring managers, these don't mean much.  The level of education and skill required to get a job as a programmer is far beyond what most of these courses cover.  What these certificates do is that they show you are interested in programming and have been making efforts on your own to learn.  For a new career, you will need more than a few online certificates.
