What I like about SoloLearn is that they keep it super simple.  They have a nice user interface and walk you through core concepts in baby steps.  You can learn quite a bit here and it is well worth purchasing the pro membership, however the free plan is good enough.

They teach introductory courses as well as some intermediate courses.  They have a strong community and also a playground to show off your scripts.
