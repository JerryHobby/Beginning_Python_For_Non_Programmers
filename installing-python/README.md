# Installing Python

Before you can start writing Python code, you’ll need to have Python installed on your computer. Python is open-source and freely available for download, which makes it accessible to everyone. Installing Python is the first step toward transforming your computer into a tool for building programs, solving problems, and exploring the world of software development.

Python is designed to run on many different platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The installation process is straightforward, and Python comes bundled with the essential tools you’ll need to start programming right away. Once installed, you’ll have access to the Python interpreter, which is the engine that runs your Python code, as well as the Python Package Installer (pip) to help you install additional libraries and modules that extend Python’s capabilities.

It’s important to make sure you have the correct version of Python installed for your needs. The latest stable version is generally recommended, but certain projects or libraries may require specific versions. Once Python is installed, you’ll be able to run your code from the command line, in a text editor like Visual Studio Code, or in an interactive environment like Jupyter Notebooks. With Python installed, you’re ready to dive into the exciting world of programming.
