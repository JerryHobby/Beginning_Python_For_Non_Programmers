# Step-by-step guide for Windows Users

To start programming in Python, the first thing you need to do is install Python on your Windows computer. Follow the steps below to install Python and set it up properly.

#### Step 1: Download the Python Installer

1. Open your web browser and go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org).
2. On the homepage, click on the **Downloads** tab.
3. The website will detect your operating system and offer the latest version of Python for Windows. Click the **Download Python (version number)** button.

#### Step 2: Run the Installer

1. Once the installer is downloaded, open it by double-clicking the file (it will likely be in your "Downloads" folder).
2. **Important:** Before clicking "Install Now," check the box that says **Add Python to PATH** at the bottom of the installer window. This will make it easier to run Python from the command line later.
3. Click **Install Now** to start the installation process.

#### Step 3: Complete the Installation

1. The installer will now copy all the necessary files to your computer. This may take a few minutes.
2. Once the installation is complete, you’ll see a screen that says **Setup was successful**.
3. Click **Close** to exit the installer.

#### Step 4: Verify the Installation

1. To make sure Python was installed correctly, open the **Command Prompt**. You can do this by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu.
2.  In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press **Enter**:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
3. If Python was installed successfully, you’ll see the installed version of Python displayed, like `Python 3.10.0`.

#### Step 5: Install pip (Python Package Installer)

pip is automatically installed with Python, but it’s good to confirm it’s available:

1.  In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press **Enter**:

    ```bash
    pip --version
    ```
2. If pip is installed, you’ll see a version number like `pip 21.2.4`. If not, follow the instructions on the [official pip website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install it.

With Python and pip installed, you’re now ready to start programming! In the next sections, we’ll cover setting up a development environment using Visual Studio Code.
