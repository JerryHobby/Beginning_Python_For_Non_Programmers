# Introduction to Programming

### Never written a line of code in your life?

The very beginning of learning to program is frequently glossed over in most online tutorials. I want to help you get off to a good start by introducing you to tutorials and small projects that are easy enough to teach the basic concepts without going so fast you are lost before you even get started.

### Want to explore the Python programming language?

Python is a great choice as a first programming language.  It is easier than many other languages, however it is very powerful.  Python was written to be easy to read and write.  It was also written to be extensible with add-ons, or modules, that give you more power.  The language can expand in any direction you need it too.

In the beginning you will write the most simple programs in order to learn how the language works.  Later you will explore these modules that empower you to create advanced data analysis tools, computer games, or whatever you want.

### What to know before you begin

Programming a computer can get very complicated.  There are a lot of concepts to learn and it will take some time.  Your first programs will feel very basic and you'll wonder "What's the point?".  Later, as you advance, the programs you write will become more complicated and will make your head spin trying to sort out the logic and resolve all the bugs.  &#x20;

People who are good at computer programming are typically very logical and like solving puzzles.  Computer programming is a type of engineering.  You'll be faced with a challenge and you will have to find a way to solve it. &#x20;

#### For example:  &#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">You may have a list of people in your contact list.  Some have birthdates in their contact card.  Some have emails.  Some have cell phone numbers.  Perhaps you want to write a program that sends a "Happy Birthday" message to them.  Your program will have to follow some logic:</mark>

* <mark style="color:blue;">Does the person have birthdate?</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">Is that birthdate today?</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Do they have an email?  If so, send them an email.</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Do they have a cell phone?  If so, send them a text.</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">But make sure you do not send an email and a text, just one or the other.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">To make it more complicated, your program must be able to actually read the contact cards and it needs to know how to actually send that email or text message.</mark>

This is a very simple example of what a computer program might do.  In reality the possibilities are endless.  You could spend ten or twenty hours writing a small program, like described above.  Or you could spend months, or even years, writing a program that helps solve more difficult problems.  &#x20;

### Where to start?

Computer programming requires special software and various tools.  Even though Python is a fairly easy to learn language, you will still need to use several tools to get everything done.  Just approach it with patience and learn what you need to know when you need to know it.   Do not worry about mastering anything. &#x20;

**Always remember - it's not about what you can't do - it's about what you can do.  Every tiny step forward makes you a tiny bit stronger.  It all adds up over time.**
